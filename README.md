Reflection:
    When I began this Ruby on Rails site I had a little experience with RoR 
    but little front end development experience. The database checking ensuring 
    that stocks are unique, are valid tickers, and always save as upper-case took 
    me on a long journey of trial and error with database and model specifications. 
    I also gained valuable experience with the front-end design aspect of 
    development. It was a process that I found both frustrating and rewarding, 
    depending on the problem I was working to solve. I learned how to use CSS and 
    Bootstrap to create a passable page structure. Additionally I became more 
    practiced at using different HTML tags and embedded ruby to accomplish specific 
    UI improvements. As can be seen on the individual stock view I had a little bit 
    of fun with inserting images that added to the user experience. I hope you have 
    enjoyed interacting with this site. Click the image link on this page at your own 
    risk (although it is perfectly safe)!
